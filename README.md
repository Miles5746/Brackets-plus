# Brackets-plus
By Miles5746 and ChatGPT

This is my first every script on Github! The point of this is to make life a tiny bit easier, by automating brackets. it automaticly completes brackets whenever you type (. Sadly, I ran into
an error when making this, where it selects the second bracket, so I made two versions: Brackets Plus and Brackets Pro. 

Brackets Plus: Pretty straight forward. Generates the ) when you type ( but won't move your cursor in between them.
Brackets Pro: When you type (, it will wait for you to type a lower-case letter to ensure shift isn't being hold, and then completes the operation.

Thank you for using this script, you are free to edit/reupload it how ever you like, as it isn't that big!
