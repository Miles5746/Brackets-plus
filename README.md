# Brackets-plus
By Miles5746 and ChatGPT

This is my first every script on Github! The point of this is to make life a tiny bit easier, by automating brackets. it automaticly completes brackets whenever you type (. Sadly, I ran into
an error when making this, where it selects the second bracket, so I made two versions: Brackets Plus and Brackets Pro. 

Brackets Plus: Pretty straight forward. Generates the ) when you type ( but won't move your cursor in between them.
Brackets Pro: When you type (, it will wait for you to type a lower-case letter to ensure shift isn't being hold, and then completes the operation.

Thank you for using this script, you are free to edit/reupload it how ever you like, as it isn't that big!

Please note that you will need to install pyautogui to allow python to type. This can easily be installed with "pip install pyautogui" - just run that in terminal.
To run this script, in terminal CD into where ever you downloaded it (Example: cd /users/YOURNAMEHERE/downloads/) and then run it with python3 (You will need to figure out how to install that out), Or just run it in Python launcher.
