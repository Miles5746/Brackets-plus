# Brackets-plus
By Miles5746 and ChatGPT

This is my first every script on Github! The point of this is to make life a tiny bit easier, by automating brackets. it automaticly completes brackets whenever you type (. Sadly, I ran into
an error when making this, where it selects the second bracket, so I made two versions: Brackets Plus and Brackets Pro. 

Brackets Plus: Pretty straight forward. Generates the ) when you type ( but won't move your cursor in between them.
Brackets Pro: When you type (, it will wait for you to type a lower-case letter to ensure shift isn't being hold, and then completes the operation.

Thank you for using this script, you are free to edit/reupload it how ever you like, as it isn't that big!

This requires macOS, unless you find a way to do it on windows or linux, as the files are in python.
How to run correctly:
1. Open terminal (Cmd+space, then type terminal)
2. Download or create a python with the script of your choice in it, and move it to documents.
3. Download Homebrew (Unless you already have) at https://brew.sh/ and set it up.
4. Type in terminal: Brew install python3 (Unless you already have python3 in terminal)
5. Type in terminal: cd /user/yournamehere/documents/
6. Type in terminal: python3 BracketsPlus (or BracketsPro if you got that)
